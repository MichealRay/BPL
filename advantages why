from original paper "Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction"
1 (1335)BPL’s advantage points to the benefits of modeling the underlying causal process in learning concepts, 
a strategy different from the particular deep learning approaches.
This is to say: among the three key ideas (compositionality, causality, and learning to learn), causality contributes 
much more than the others.

2 (1336)Machine learning and computer vision researchers are beginning to explore methods based on
simple program induction(36–41), and our results show that this approach can perform one-shot
learning in classification tasks at human-level accuracy and fool most judges in visual Turing tests
of its more creative abilities.
It (BPL) lacks explicit knowledge of parallel lines, symmetry, optional elements such as cross bars
in “ 7” s, and connections between the ends of strokes and other strokes.
